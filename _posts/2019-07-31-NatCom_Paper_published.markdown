Our paper *'Profiling Host ANP32A Splicing Landscapes to Predict Influenza A Virus Polymerase Adaptation'* is published in [Nature Communications][link paper]. It comes with a [Shiny-App][link shiny] with which you can determine whether your bird species is a selector for human-adapted influenza strains. The models and analyses can be found on my [github page][link github].
