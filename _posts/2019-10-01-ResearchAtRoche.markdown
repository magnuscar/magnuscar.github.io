Today was my first day of research in big pharma -- I started a job at Hoffmann - La Roche. Now I will use my researcher mind to help providing Clinical Decision Support at [DIS][link DIS] (Diagnostics Information Solutions). I keep on being interested in the developments in the HIV vaccine field but I am also very happy about being part of the future of healthcare - this time in a pharma setting!
