<img align="left" src="/img/broadinterest.jpg" style="width: 200px;" hspace="15px"/> Carsten's research is driven by the question of how antibodies neutralise viral infections such as HIV or Influenza, and how viruses shape the evolution of the immune system and _vice versa_. We employ mathematical models such as stochastic processes, statistics, differential equations, phylodynamics, and antigenic mapping to unravel these mysteries. Mathematical models are crucial in modern biology, because they can be used to analyse big data data, to make predictions leading to testable hypotheses, to guide optimal experiment design, and to be able to transfer one concept from one are to another. Thus, our research is most often performed in close collaboration with experimentalists. We are specifically interested in the following topics:



### Which antibody concentrations are needed to neutralise HIV?

### How does the virus protect itself from antibody binding?

### Which antibody concentrations facilitate escape mutations?

### How can we measure viral fitness?

### How can we use mathematical models to personalise vaccination schemes?
A protective anti-HIV vaccine is the ultimate goal of HIV research, because such a vaccine could lead to eradication of HIV. However, no HIV vaccine tested until now has been successful in mounting a protective immune response ([Bla et al1][link NoVacc]). The vaccine research community uses so called _broadly neutralising antibodies_ as blueprints for vaccine design ([Burton et al][link blueprint]). These antibodies arise in a small percentage of HIV-infected individuals after a long period of virus-antibody coevolution. We develop methods to study virus-antibody coevolution to help guiding vaccine design.
