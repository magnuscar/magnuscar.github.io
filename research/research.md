<img align="left" src="/img/broadinterest.jpg" style="width: 200px;" hspace="15px"/> Carsten's research is driven by the questions of how antibodies neutralise viral infections such as HIV or Influenza, and how viruses shape the evolution of the immune system and _vice versa_. We borrow mathematics from various fields such as stochastic processes, statistics, differential equations, phylodynamics, and antigenic mapping to unravel these mysteries. Mathematical models are crucial in modern biology, because they can be used to analyse big data, to make predictions leading to testable hypotheses, to guide optimal experiment design, and to be able to transfer one concept from one area to another. Thus, our research is most often performed in close collaboration with experimentalists. We are specifically interested in the following topics:



### Which antibody concentrations are needed to neutralise HIV?
<img align="left" src="/img/infectionprobabilites_varKD.jpg" style="width: 200px;" hspace="15px"/> Antibodies have the ability to protect against new infection if (i) the antibody has the potential to efficiently neutralise HIV virions and (ii) the antibodies are present in sufficiently high concentrations at the port of entry. We derived a complete theory of antibody based neutralisation building upon numerical values of viral entry (how many viral spikes are required such that the the virion can infect its host cell) and neutralisation (how many antibodies have to bind to one spike such that it looses its functionality). The picture shows the main result, namely a prediction of penile to vaginal transmission probability as a function of antibody concentration. This framework is nicely described in our latest paper on antibody based neutralisation, which you can find [here][link probInf]. In the future, we will extend this framework to study the effect of passively transferred antibodies.  



### Which antibody concentrations facilitate escape mutations?
<img align="left" src="/img/MSW-theory.jpg" style="width: 200px;" hspace="15px"/> When antibodies are present in concentrations that are not sufficient for complete neutralisation, the virus population can evolve resistant viral strains. These concentrations are referred to as _mutant selection windows_. These ranges can be calculated by comparing the fitness of the antibody sensitive strain and a resistance mutation as displayed in the picture to the left. Determining these concentrations are important when antibodies are used as therapeutic interventions, as resistance evolution needs to be prevented. We describe this framework [here][link MSW]. In the future, we will use this concept to predict failure of antibody-based neutralisation.


### How does the virus protect itself from antibody binding?
<img align="left" src="/img/neighprot.jpg" style="width: 200px;" hspace="15px"/> The HIV spike is extremely variable and a difficult target for antibodies. Several regions on the HIV spike are variable, the so called _variable loops_. In particular, the variable loop V1V2 has been proven to extend in length during disease progression. This loop has the ability to protect epitopes. We developed methods to unravel whether this loop can protect epitopes located on neighbouring protomers or on the same protomer. Our mathematical models predict different outcomes for particular setups of binding experiments. In [Magnus et al. 2013][link V1V2Theo] we summarise these methods and give an overview about their applicability.


### How does within-host evolution influence between-host reconstruction?
<img align="left" src="/img/Between-Within.jpg" style="width: 200px;" hspace="15px"/> During HIV infection the initially very few transmitted viral strains evolve to an extremely diverse population of viral strains, often referred to as _quasispecies_. Only very few of these strains are transmitted. Phylogenetic methods are used to reconstruct transmission chains of HIV infection based on sequences sampled from HIV infected individuals. We study under which conditions the within-host diversity still allows correct transmission chain reconstruction.

### How can we use mathematical models to personalise vaccination schemes?

A protective anti-HIV vaccine is the ultimate goal of HIV research, because such a vaccine could lead to eradication of HIV. However, no HIV vaccine tested until now has been successful in mounting a protective immune response (e.g. summarised in [Klein et al. 2013][link NoVacc]). The vaccine research community uses so called _broadly neutralising antibodies_ as blueprints for vaccine design ([Burton et al. 2012][link blueprint]). These antibodies arise in a small percentage of HIV-infected individuals after a long period of virus-antibody coevolution. We develop methods to study virus-antibody coevolution with the goal to help rationally design sequential vaccines.
