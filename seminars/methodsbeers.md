subtitle: Bringing together scientist from academia and industry.

<img align="left" src="/img/MBlogo.jpg" style="width: 200px;" hspace="15px"/> _Methods & Beers_ series is a meeting of people from institutions in the Basel area with an interest in data analysis methods. We come together, exchange ideas, and have a beer and snack. It is an intentionally informal, participant driven meeting; we believe this gives a good environment for lively discussion and exchange of ideas. We cover fields that are interesting for both academic research and research in industry. See also the [description][link MBBSSE] by D-BSSE.
