## Dr. Carsten Magnus

<img src="/img/carsten2.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 150px;" hspace="15px" align="left"/>  After having studied mathematics, chemistry, and German literature in MÃ¼nster, Germany, I transferred to theoretical biology for my PhD. Already then I started working on antibody binding against HIV in [Roland Regoes' group][link Roland]. Multiple aspects of antibodies binding against HIV have been the focus of [my research][link my research] ever since. My PhD was followed by research in [Angela McLean's mathematical biology group][link Oxford]. In [Alexandra Trkola's group][link Alexandra], I had the pleasure to work in direct collaboration with exerperimental virologists. Since September 2015 I have been continuing my research as a senior scientist (Oberassistent) in [Tanja Stadler's group][link Tanja]. I am establishing my own research group at the moment. If you are interested in my research, want to join the group or want to fund me, please [contact me][link contact]. When I am not researching, I am most likely found playing music as I am playing in several orchestras including [ALSO][link also], [AKO][link ako], and [i baroccoli][link Brokkoli].


## Master students

**Valerio Tettamanti** studies the visual ecology of Naso brevirostris and Naso vlamingii, two species of the genus unicornfish in the [Sensory Neurobiology Group][link Sensory Biology] the at Queensland Brain Institute, Queensland, Australia with [Fabio Cortesi][link Fabio Cortesi] and [Fanny de Busserolles][link Fanny]. Carsten is happy to learn more about unicornfishes while being Valerio's supervisor at ETH Zurich.





## Alumni

**Ziliya Usmanova** studied how one can estimate the timing of antibody induced mutation evolution in her Master thesis. She finished her studies in February 2018 and obtained a Msc in Biology.

**Francesco Bosia** joined Carsten's group already twice. First for a short research project and then for his master thesis. Francesco simulated HIV within-host evolution to test which factors influence how well transmission trees can be reconstructed based on randomly sampled sequences. Francesco finished his thesis in August 2017 and joined [Markus Reiher's group][lab Fran] for a PhD in theoretical chemistry to implement software for interactive quantum chemistry.

**Leonie Hodel**, **Helena Crowell**, and **Julia Mehl** studied various aspects of antibody binding to HIV in smaller research projects.
