Carsten believes that good researchers also need to be good teachers. Only students who discover the world with the eyes of a researcher will become good researchers. We help the students to develop their scientific interests.



### Lectures
Carsten lectures at the ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich in the following courses:

 - Computational biology at ETH (organised by [Prof Tanja Stadler][link cevo]); in this master level course we give an overview of how mathematical models can be used to extract information out of genetic sequences, ranging from molecular evolution,  GWAS, and phylogenetics to phylodynamic analyses
   - [2017][link CB17] first time using moodle, and graded programming exercises
   - [2016][link CB16]
   - [2015][link MEPP] under the name 'Molecular Evolution, Phylogenetics, and Phylodynamics'


 - Quantitative life sciences: from infectious diseases to ecosystems (organised by [Prof Roger Kouyos][link Roger]); in this bachelor level course, several researchers present their field of expertise and Prof Kouyos group organises accompanying programming exercises
   - [2017][link QL17]
   - [2016][link QL16]
